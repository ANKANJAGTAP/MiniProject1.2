## 🎯 When Notifications Are Sent

### Owner Notifications:
**Trigger:** Customer creates a new booking
**Channels:** Email + SMS
**Content:**
- Customer details (name, email, phone)
- Booking details (date, time, slot)

### Customer Notifications:
**Trigger:** Owner approves/rejects booking
**Channels:** Email + SMS
**Content:**
- Booking status (confirmed/rejected)
- Turf details

## 🐛 Debugging

### Check Logs:
```bash
# Server console will show:
13. Booking created successfully, sending notifications...
✅ Email notification sent to owner
✅ SMS notification sent to owner
14. Notifications processing completed
```

### Common Issues:

**Email not sending:**
- Check app password (not regular password)
- Verify 2FA is enabled
- Check spam folder
- Test with: `node test-email.js`

**SMS not sending:**
- Verify phone number format (+91xxxxxxxxxx)
- Check Twilio console for logs
- Ensure number is verified (trial account)
- Test with: `node test-sms.js`
